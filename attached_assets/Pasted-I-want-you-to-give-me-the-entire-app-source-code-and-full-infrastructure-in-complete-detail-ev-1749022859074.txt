I want you to give me the **entire app source code and full infrastructure** in complete detail — every file, folder, config, and logic that’s running this app. I mean everything — leave nothing out. Be specific and clear.

Here’s exactly what I need:

1. **Frontend Code**  
   - Full HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or React files  
   - Any UI frameworks or styling libraries in use  
   - Event handling logic  
   - Audio/TTS output logic (if present)  
   - Any animations or input/output display logic  
   - All public assets like images, icons, fonts, etc.

2. **Backend Code**  
   - Full server code (Python/Flask, Node/Express, etc.)  
   - All route handlers and endpoints  
   - AI chat integration (OpenAI calls, prompt logic, switching between models)  
   - TTS integration (OpenAI voice API or others)  
   - Auth logic (OAuth, login, signup, sessions)  
   - API key usage and handling  
   - File upload/download endpoints (if any)

3. **Environment and Config Files**  
   - `.env` file (keys redacted but structure intact)  
   - `.replit` file  
   - `replit.nix` (or package management setup)  
   - `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, or equivalent dependency files  
   - `.gitignore`  
   - Any secrets, runtime variables, build scripts

4. **Supporting Systems**  
   - Data storage logic (SQLite, Supabase, Firebase, etc.)  
   - LocalStorage or session handling in frontend  
   - Any scheduled tasks, webhooks, or background services  
   - Any error logging, reporting, or analytics systems

5. **Directory Structure**  
   - A tree view of the full folder/file structure of the project  
   - Label each file with its purpose if not obvious  
   - Tell me which files are essential and which are optional

6. **Output Format**  
   - Either give me the entire codebase as one downloadable zip  
   - Or give me each file in full with its name and code block one after another

Important: do not give just summaries or snippets. I want the full raw working codebase so I can review or migrate it if needed.
