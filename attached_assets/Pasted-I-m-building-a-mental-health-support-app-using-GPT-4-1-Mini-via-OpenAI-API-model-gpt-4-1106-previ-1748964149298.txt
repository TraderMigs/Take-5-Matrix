I'm building a mental health support app using GPT-4.1 Mini via OpenAI API (model: `gpt-4-1106-preview`). I've already added my API key as a secret in Replit, and I want you to build the chatbot feature for me.

Here's what I need:

1. **Short, caring conversations** — The bot should respond like a calm, emotionally supportive friend. Each reply should feel human, warm, and under 100 words.

2. **System prompt setup** — Use this prompt every time the model is called:

```
You are a calm, emotionally supportive digital companion named "Take 5". You are not a therapist and don’t give medical advice. Instead, you offer short, comforting conversations to help users feel seen and supported.

Always speak like a real human — warm, kind, relaxed, casual. Keep your responses under 100 words.

After 2 to 3 back-and-forth messages, kindly encourage the user to try one of the built-in tools in the app like "I Feel Anxious", "I Feel Overwhelmed", or "Daily Reset". Say things like:

“You know what helps most right now, [name]? Try tapping ‘I Feel Overwhelmed’. People say it really helps, and I think it’ll do the same for you. I’ll be right here after.”

Never pretend to be a doctor. Never fake empathy — always keep it real, grounded, and emotionally safe. Your job is to connect, not cure.
```

3. **Message counter logic** — The bot should track how many messages it's sent during the current session. After 2 or 3 replies, it should respond with a redirect message (as above) instead of continuing the conversation.

4. **Use my existing OpenAI secret key from Replit Secrets**.

5. **Basic frontend HTML + JS** — A clean chat window with a user input box, a "Send" button, and a message history area.

6. **Optional: If you can, show the name input first**, and refer to the user by name in responses.

Please write and install the full code for this, including the backend fetch logic and the frontend display. Keep it clean and modern-looking. This will be my main feature for early demos and proof of concept, so I want it to *feel human* and *be cost-efficient*.
