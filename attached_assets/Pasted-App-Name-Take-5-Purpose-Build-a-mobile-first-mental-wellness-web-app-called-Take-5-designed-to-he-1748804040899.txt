App Name: Take 5

Purpose:Build a mobile-first mental wellness web app called Take 5, designed to help people in emotional crisis or distress take a moment to pause, breathe, and access help quickly. This app should feel like a safe space — simple, intuitive, non-judgmental — and offer real-time access to tools, support, or someone to reach out to in their darkest moments.

🌍 Who It’s For:

Military veterans, like myself, struggling with PTSD, depression, or suicidal ideation

Teens and young people facing bullying, anxiety, or family issues

People experiencing homelessness or isolation

Anyone dealing with emotional overload, fear, or hopelessness

People of all backgrounds, ages, and languages

🧠 Home Screen Design

Layout:

App name at top: Take 5

Subheading or tagline below: “Take 5 minutes. Take a breath. Take back control.”

Search bar underneath (user types how they feel: "I’m alone," "homeless," "want to talk")

Just below that: show location-based emergency contact number (911, suicide hotline, etc.)

Main Menu:
Below the search bar, display clear, clickable choices such as:

I feel overwhelmed

I’m homeless

I feel suicidal

I need someone to talk to

I’m being bullied

I’ve hurt myself

I just want quiet support

Each button leads to a specific support module.

🧩 Support Modules (Pages or Popups)

Each module includes:

A calm message: “You’re not alone. You matter.”

Local hotline or emergency call button

Option to text/call a saved emergency contact

Quiet support options like:

Guided breathing

Positive affirmations (text/audio/video)

Calming music or safe YouTube content

Short mental reset exercises

Let users choose what level of interaction they’re ready for — even if it’s none.

🛠 Onboarding Personalization

During setup or on first use, ask:

Are you a veteran?

Are you under 18?

Would you like to add trusted emergency contacts?

Would you like a personalized home screen?

Based on answers:

Display relevant suicide prevention hotlines (like VA lines for vets)

Offer to add personal contact buttons (parent, teacher, therapist, friend)

Automatically show appropriate emergency services for the user’s country (911, 999, etc.)

🌐 Global and Inclusive Design

App should detect user’s country and show local emergency numbers

Support multiple languages based on user device/browser settings

Fully responsive layout (mobile-first)

Gender, age, cultural, and language inclusive

Anonymous — no login required to use main features

🔇 For Users Who Don’t Want to Talk

If they choose “I don’t want to talk right now,” lead them to:

A peaceful interface with:

Calming visuals

Breathing timers

Grounding techniques

Soothing affirmations or short positive quotes

Peaceful YouTube videos or soundtracks

All aimed at slowing down their racing thoughts and helping them feel safe for just one more minute

✨ Optional Technical Preferences (If Hostinger AI Supports)

PWA-ready (for installable experience)

Search bar must return related modules by emotion or keyword

Customizable home screen with drag-and-drop icons or saved buttons

Ability to store local emergency contacts (stored locally, not online)

Tone and Goal:Make Take 5 feel like a safe, non-intrusive space. It’s not a therapy platform. It’s not a cold chatbot. It’s that moment where a person in crisis can take a breath, get what they need, and not feel alone — even if just for five minutes.
